- Basic GADT example
   + type families

- Template Haskell example

- Data.Type.Equality

- Singleton naturals
   + proof of associativity

- modular math
   + with TypeLits

- Functional extensionality for QuickCheck
   + should be done with instance chains!

- Dependently-typed sorting algorithm
   + quickCheck your dependently typed code!
   + look! it's a dependently-typed merge sort!

- units
